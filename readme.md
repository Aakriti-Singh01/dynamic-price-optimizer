## 🎯 Problem Statement

Pricing is one of the most critical decisions in business, yet many systems still rely on fixed rules or intuition.  
This often leads to missed revenue opportunities because demand changes with price, promotions, competition, and seasonality.

## 💡 Solution

This project builds an end-to-end pricing optimization system that:

- 📈 Predicts demand based on business conditions
- 💰 Simulates multiple price points
- 🎯 Identifies the price that maximizes revenue
- 🔍 Explains the recommendation using visual and feature-based insights

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 📈 Revenue Optimization Curve

- Visualizes the relationship between price and revenue
- Highlights the optimal price point
- Helps users understand why a recommendation was made

### 🔍 Explainable Pricing

- Converts model behavior into simple, human-readable insights
- Highlights the main drivers behind the recommendation:
  - 💲 Price sensitivity
  - 🏷️ Promotions
  - 🏪 Competition

### ⚖️ A/B Price Comparison

- Compares different pricing strategies such as ₹300 vs ₹400
- Shows:
  - 📊 Mean revenue
  - 📉 Risk (variability in outcomes)

### 🟡 Confidence Indicator

- Displays confidence levels (High / Moderate / Low)
- Helps users assess reliability of recommendations

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model:** XGBoost Regressor
- **Task:** Demand Prediction
- **Output:** Predicted sales used for revenue optimization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- 🌐 Streamlit
- ⚡ XGBoost
- 📊 Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📈 Matplotlib
- 🧩 SHAP
- 💾 Joblib
